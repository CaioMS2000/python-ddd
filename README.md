# My DDD Project

This is a sample project demonstrating Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in Python. It emphasizes good modularity and separation of concerns, providing a standardized structure for handling successes and failures.

Most of the code was generated by Claude AI to serve as a sample of good software development practices. This code was built from the following conversation:

**me** - can you create a Python project code that implements DDD patterns, good modularity, and separation of concerns?  
**Claude** - I will create an example Python project that implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, with good modularity and separation of concerns.  
...  
**me** - also make a good way to handle successes and failures of functionalities, which is standardized throughout the project  
**Claude** - I will create a standardized structure to handle successes and failures using a Result/Either pattern and custom exceptions.

## How to run:
Execute the command `python main.py` in your terminal to start the application.
